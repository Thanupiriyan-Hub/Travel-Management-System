# Travel Management System

## Overview
The **Travel Management System** is a project developed for an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) subject. It is designed to simplify and organize travel-related tasks such as managing trips, bookings, and user details. The system leverages core OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to ensure a modular, reusable, and maintainable codebase.

## Features
- **User Management**: Add, view, and update user details.
- **Booking Management**: Handle bookings, including creation, modification, and deletion.
- **Travel Destinations**: Manage information about available travel destinations.
- **Reports and Summaries**: Generate summaries for user travel data.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **OOP Concepts**:
  - Inheritance
  - Encapsulation
  - Polymorphism
  - Constructors and Destructors
  - Operator Overloading

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/travel-management-system.git
   cd travel-management-system
   ```
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler, e.g., `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o TravelManagementSystem
   ```
3. Run the compiled executable:
   ```bash
   ./TravelManagementSystem
   ```

## Usage
1. Follow the menu options to navigate through the system.
2. Add, update, or delete users and bookings as required.
3. View reports to track user travel history and statistics.

## Project Structure
- **main.cpp**: Entry point for the application.
- **Classes and Objects**: Implementation of various features using OOP principles.
- **Modules**: Divided into separate functions to improve readability and maintainability.

## OOP Features Highlighted
- **Encapsulation**: Private member variables with public getter and setter methods.
- **Inheritance**: Base class for common properties, derived classes for specific functionalities.
- **Polymorphism**: Function overloading and overriding for flexible method behavior.
- **Operator Overloading**: Custom operator implementation for specialized use cases.
